## A BETTER AUDIENCE
A Better Audience” An app for presenting presentations

What is this Application?

- This Application provides an environment where the users “audience” can interact with a series of presentations. 
The users are able to see upcoming presentations, 
their most recent reviews for presentations, and most importantly, they are able to create their own presentation.

What is a stage?

- Stage - A stage can be thought of like a classroom or an environment in which a user can create so that presentations can be added. 
Once a stage is created, users can now see the stage publicly and therefore can add presentations to the stage in order to present. 
It is analogous to how a teacher can create a class and students can choose to sign up for the class or not.

          
          
Why did we create this app?

- Our thinking behind creating this app was that this would be very beneficial and useful in an academic setting. 
The app’s purpose is to enable users to share presentations through a single interface. Users will also be able to review each 
presentation and vote on the presentation they liked most. An application of this could be if a professor wanted to make a peer reviewed assignment,
the teacher could instead use this application.

The teacher would Create a stage.

- Students would upload their assignments on the stage.

- Students would vote on their favorite assignment.

- Students would get graded according to the reviews on the assignment
